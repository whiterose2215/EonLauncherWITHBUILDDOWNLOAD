# EonLauncherWITHBUILDDOWNLOAD
This project is the eon launcher made by *zinx28* and the orignal can be found here: https://github.com/eonfn/Launcher-V1, using this download launcher and removing my credits (*whiterose*) will result in me talking action, I want both of our credits in there OR you can remove it from the launcher and star this repo and add it into ur discord, if someone is stealing it dm me @whiterose2251 on discord please.
How to use: Grab you dll from your backend *I recomend aurura runtimes it works the BEST* https://github.com/Beat-YT/Aurora.Runtime
Then go into mainwindow xaml and add your fortnite build link which you can get from here: https://github.com/n6617x/Fortnitebuilds
And change your logo, Ive seen people have issues with there logo not popping up and here is how to fix it, click on the exit logo (E) and read were it says source, replace that "source" with your image link. Add the image in here and copy the link: https://imgbb.com
Also, click build and publish selection to let others download the launcher!
ENJOY, *please star the repo*
